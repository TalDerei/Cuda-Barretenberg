# Problems
```Need to integrate cuda-fixnum external library and add cuda / nvcc support```

    - The core problem was that I was unable to call Barretenberg dependencies (e.g. #include <ecc/curves/grumpkin/grumpkin.hpp>) from a cuda file (.cu extension). I set the default system compiler as clang/clang++ using the x86_64-linux-clang toolchain. Nvidia's NVCC compiler was forwarding certain flags to the host compiler using the "-XCompiler" command, since certain barretenberg dependencies relied on that flag being set and compiled by the host. Still the compilation errors persisted. Another approach was creating a static library containing these dependencies, and dynamically linking the library to the cuda file upon creating the executable. But from the cuda file, you can only call certain functions from that library (not dependencies) since a static library is just a collection of linkable object .o files. 

    Then I thought it was a cuda-version compatability issue, where the cuda version might not support the compiler setup: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#system-requirements. Turns out there wasn't any nvcc compatability issues with any of the installed tooling.
    
        ubuntu: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
        clang++: 14.0.0-1ubuntu1
        nvcc: 11.8
        
        gcc: can't use since flag that a dependency relies 
        on (e.g. -fconstexpr-steps=100000000) isn't           
        recognized by gcc compiler

    Finally, I looked deeper into constexpr (feature added in c++11) which adds performance improvements by evaluating computations at compile-time rather than run-time, which speeds up the execution. Digging deeper, I found that NVCC compiler does not currently support C++20. Barretenberg has files with C20++ features (i.e. is_constant_evaluated()), so the compilation fails. We can't offload this to be compiled by the host compiler either. Only solution is to remove this, and add -std=c++17 as a compilation flag. 

    It's also worth noting that NVCC will always require a general purpose C++ host compiler. You can set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD and CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD values to c++17 so C++-files and CUDA-files can both be compiled according to c++17.

```Structure of the finite field arithmetic and elliptic curve operations (BN-254 and Grumpkin) on GPU```
    - Montgomery representation is alternative way of representing elements of Fr/Fq for more efficient multiplication. Let r be BN-254.r or q be Grumpkin.q and R = 2^256. The Montgomery representation of the nubmer x (e.g. 5) is (xR) mod p. This number then is represented as a little-endian length 4 array of 64-bit integers, where each element in the array is called a limb. 

    Usually we're used to working 32-bit/64-bit integers. With SNARK provers, the integers are much larger. The integers are 256 bits and represented using arrays of integers. For example, we could represent them using an array of 4 64-bit integers (since 4 * 64 = 256 > 254). 

    Q. Difference between BN-254 and Grumpkin curves?
        BN-254 is pairing-friendly elliptic curve. Grumpkin is a curve on top of BN-254 for SNARK efficient group operations. It forms a curve cycle with BN-254, so the field and group order of Grumpkin are equal group and field order of BN-254. 

```Starting to dive into the unit testing (each module has its own set of tests). Need to figure out what the hexadecimal represents for bn254/fq.hpp for example, and how simple calculations (i.e. addition/subtraction/multiplication/division) translate between hex numbers?```

    - Figured out the modulus is deconstructed into smaller parts, i.e. a 256-bit number is represented by 4 64-bit limbs.

```Currently the recompilation process for making any change is taking a long time. Need to figure out how to speed this up. Additionally, need to figure out how to print print statements in constant expressions?```

    - Fastest solution I found was to just comment out the other files containing the other test cases that aren't currenlty being benchmarked in order to speed up the compilation process. The issue is that printf format strings are interpreted at runtime rather than compiler time. Looking at external library called "Compile-Time Printer" for priting types and values at compile-time in C++ -- seems like a promising solution. Debugging compile-time statements seems harder than it should be....decided to get around this by using the GDB debugger instead of print statements in trying to debug what's going on. 

```Need to differentiate between Fq and Fr, and also need to figure out how to convert the hexadecimal representation of the fields to decimal to verify they match up?```

    - Fq represents the base field for BN-254, while Fr represents the scalar field. In order to get the hexidecimal representation of the number, convert the decimal representation to hexidecimal, split it up into 4 equal limbs, and take the reverse order. 

```Need to figure out an effective method for testing cuda functions correctness. There doesn't seem to be a framework for cuda testing.```

    - Depaul recommends simply writing reference kernels to test. In order to debug, need to also disable compiler optimizations -O3 and compiler with -O0 since the compiler is optimizing out a lot of the intermediary steps and not letting me see what's going on under the hood. Another option is to extract and isolate the workload into a seperate c++ file, test it out locally with print statements there since I can't add print statements to constant expressions. 

```Need to figure out how to integrate cuda-fixnum logic to use their montgomery multiplication implementation. ```

    - The problem is the field elements are being intialized on the device, and the cuda-fixnum functions make calls to host functions before calling a dispatch() function, which is a kernel. Tried doing a sample montgomery multiplication by modifying the cuda-fixnum base types from uint8_t * to uint64_t *. Seems to be an incorrect result. Need to verify if: [1] initializing the values is not done correctly, or [2] moving from uint8_t * to uint64_t * breaks the cuda-fixnum code, or [3] the issue is with how the numbers are being printed and need to convert it to/from montgomery representation, or [4] how i'm retrieveing the values from calling get_fixnum_array() or print()_fixnum_array. Update: I ended up scrapping using the ENTIRE cuda-fixnum library, and used the minimal implementation used in the groth16 codebase. The modular multiplication (CIOS) works now

```Need to figure out how the reduce() algorithm fits into the from_montgomery_form() and to_montgomery_form() algorithms, and if we get the same results by using the from_monty() and to_monty() functions in cud-fixnum. Also need to figure out how we're able to call montgomery multiplication algorithms (both on barretenberg and cuda-fixnum without expolierlty converting to montgomery form)?```

    - What migth be happening, from initial intution, is that EC calls are loading in the points and converting them to montgomery form, and then the FF arithemtic is operating on those representations. What doesn't make sense is why we can call montgomery multiplication before transforming them field elements into montgomery representation. One possibility is [1] the algorithm does the conversion for you and finds the Montgomery representation of the product, but doesn't do the conversion back, or [2] the algorithm doesn't do the conversion for you and finds the Montgomery representation of the product, but doesn't do the conversion back. In both cases, the product is still in montgomery representation. Update: ended up using cuda-fixnum for converting to and from montgomery representation. Still need to look deeper into how these reductions works.

```Need to understand the BN-254 G1 parameters?```

    - These are curve parameters a and b (y^2 = x^3 + ax + b), cofactor, and group generators
    
```Why is the first run of cuda functions much slower than the subsequent runs? ```

    - There might be some sort of caching effects happening, and need to verify these results with compiler optimizations -03 turned on, which are currently disabled for gdb testing purposes.  

```I have a struct T = {x, y, z} and Z = {x, y}, and each of the inner variables represent a length-4 array of 64-bit integers. I’m calling a device function mixed_addition (from a kernel) to add structs T + Z. One method is since there are 5 arrays w/ 4 elements each, I can execute the kernel on 4 threads, and each thread focuses on different array indices. Here’s my question. How can I perform the same parallelization by calling mixed_addition by passing in the top-level structs T and Z (instead of the individual arrays themselves)? And how does the kernel know how to operate more complex data structures / structs? ```

    - For arrays, you need to calculate the index each thread will be operating on with the following formula: tid = (blockDim.x * blockIdx.x) + threadIdx.x; For more complex data structures, currently looking into cuda's memory grid heirachy and streams. For testing purposes, I'll treat everything like a var and see if that works, but in production, will need to figure out how to parallelize on the element / affine element level. Also look into the concept of "grid-stride loops". 

```I'm having math correctness errors when trying to do group arithemtic for some reason? The math isn't consistent, as sometimes the values are what you expect, other times it isn't...```

    - The issue is apparent when trying to square a field element, and adding the original element to itself. For example, x = x^2 + x in my implementation with cuda-fixnum isn't yielding the same results as barretenberg for some reason, very strange! Further digging seems to suggest that low-level math primitives aren't the problem, but instead the extensive use of operator overloading that's sometimes a bit confusing. Update: The solution was sub_coarse() with double the field size as the modulus for some reason, but not sure when to use it? Seems like it's only needed for some group operations at the moment. 

```Getting correctness errors for some of the G1 unit tests when trying to do elliptic curve operations...still debugging the exact issues.```

    - It's still giving issues when trying to add two of the same numbers on the ECC add() function, still figuring out why? Barretenberg uses twice_modulus (twice_modulus = modulus + modulus), twice_not_modulus (-twice_modulus), and not_modulus (-modulus) constructs for some reason in the arithmetic. Additionally, the subtraction and addition logic operates on twice the modulus. There's a "modulus.data[3] >= 0x4000000000000000ULL" check at the beggining of many of the functions's but it's never executed. Also not sure why the threshold is set to 0x4000000000000000ULL, maybe this is an optimized value. Update: It's an issue between reading results to and from montgomery form, so to ensure correctness always remember to convert results back from mongomery form. Need to still investigate why I can't add the same number to itself in ECC::add() function.

```Execution times need to be looked further into + optimized down the line, as I'm only focusing on correctness right now.```

    - Firstly, need to research the limitations around running more threads. Currently running 4 threads, and the execution is running sequentially in a single SM. Also unsure why the execution times are so drastic, as there seems to be some caching built in that's speeding up subsequent runs of the same computation. Also remember to enable compiler optimizations -03 during benchmarking! Update: “just-in-time” compiling PTX code to SASS assembly instructions slows down the first kernel invocation, so need to pass in "-gencode arch=compute_86,code=sm_86" to get around that. 

```Need to figure out why the pippenger and polynomial bench isn't working?```

    - Ignition trusted setup ceremony says 100.8M (~2^26-2^27). It’s split up across 20 files, and ./bootstrap.sh was only configured to download the first 3 transcripts. Running “./download_ignition.sh” downloads the rest of the transcripts. Still, the pippenger bench is segfaulting (core dumped) for some reason. Update: I fixed the seg faults by pointing to the correct srs_db directory and commenting out some benchmark tests. Need to also figure out the difference in execution times between the pippenger and polynomial benches for Multi-scalar multiplication...update: seems like std::chrono time is generally slower in benchmarking. 

```Notes while performing simple double and add MSM```

    - Questions:
    1. How to expand this to perform on an actual Fq point and Fr scalar?
        --> They operate over different prime fields, but Fr scalar doesn't participate 
        in the addition / multiplication calculations, only multiples of the Fq curve element. 
    2. How to expand to add a vector of Fq points?
    2. How to expand to add a vector of G1 curve points?
    3. How to expand this to perform on a vector of points and scalars?

    Notes:
    - Seems like barretenberg doesn't have methods to multipliy fq * g1 or g1 * g1, or fq * g1.x or g1.x * g1.x
    - Performing a double and then add, e.g. ec + ec = 2ec, then 2ec + ec = 3ec yields the same results in gpu tests
    and barretenberg. But ec + ec = 2ec, then 2ec + ec = 3ec, then 3ec + ec = 4ec isn't yielding the same results
    as 2ec + 2ec with doubling. Need to investigate, because seems like a montgomery representation problem. 

    Even on Barretenberg,the results might be different. It's converting everything to montgomery form before starting the calculation,
    and the assert check still passes. Some conversions going on in the equality '==' check. 

    To standardarize the results between barretenberg and my test suites, we'll do the following:
    1. For FF code, don't need to convert to and from montgomery representation unless it's a multiplication operation.
    2. For ECC code, always convert to and from montgomery representation code. 

    We'll follow the same spec as Barretenberg, without all of the extra confusing operator overloading ops. Need to perform both calculations in both ways to and compare the difference.

    Most important thing I've learned building these MSM tests is that a single thread cannot perform multiple calculations inside the kernel invocation, instead things like additions operate on thread blocks of width 4, otherwise the result is corrupted. 

```Where are extension fields used in the calculation?```
    - Different extensions of the same base field would be used for different polynomials your committing to (e.g. permutation or quotient polynomial for example). The pairing groups, both G2 and GT, are specifically defined over extension fields. 

```Is MSM performed more commonly on affine, jacobian, or projective elements?```
    - Affine elements are transformed to Jacobian or Projective elements for more efficient modular additions. 

```Notes while performing pippengers bucket method```
    - 1. We're not handling all the bucket modules for some reason....
    It's either a occupancy limit problem or data initialization probelem. It doesn't seem to be a data initialization problem,
    because shifting the blockId by a constant factor revealed the missing data. It has to be an occupancy limit. The naive way 
    to deal with this is moving to a more powerful GPU, i.e. A10. I need to figure out another standard way to deal with this. Update:
    the issue here was an if statement within the kernel that blocks the conditional execution of some threads. Fixed.

    2. How are these buckets logically seperated into bucket modules? where's the logical seperation happening in the code?
    Using offsets

    3. And why are some buckets empty when calling the accumulate_buckets_kernel, and why do we index on single_bucket_indices
    instead of point_indices?
    We have N buckets to compute, each with a variable size M. N * M = total num buckets. We're sorting based on single_bucket_indices,
    so not every sequential indice correpsonds to a filled bucket. So buckets will be empty by design. The more threads you have, the more 
    densely populated these buckets will be. 

    Steps:
        1. Initialize buckets num_modules << c
        2. Split b-bit scalats into c-bit scalars and assign each of them in a "bucket_index". One sub-scalar per index.
        3. Then group the similiar sub-scalars together into buckets (single_bucket_indices and bucket_sizes) for each bucket. 
            This is just a logical mapping. The total number of unique buckets will be smaller. So to recape, e.g. we have 16216 unique buckets,
            those are split into single_bucket_indices up to 26k, and each unique bucket has a non-zero size. 
        4. Then launch the bucket accumulation to add the points together in each bucket. This is done for each bucket module. Note
            that some buckets are empty since they weren't filled. See #3 above.
        5. Apply a sum reduction to reduce all the buckets into a single value in each bucket module
        6. Final accumulation step to sum up the partial sums into a final output.

    Open Questions:

    4. Need to reconcile why it works with c = 10, but not c = 16. Should be the same!
    The result from accumulate_buckets_kernel is not the same, since different subscalars can be mapped 
    to a wide larger net of buckets and scalars are split differently, but the result of the partial sums 
    after bucket_module_sum_reduction_kernel should be the same, but it's not...so i need to pin point the 
    area where the variance is occuring. Update: because a simple sum reduction kernel is not the correct approach, 
    instead need to implement the "running sum method". 

    5. The above tasks represent optimizations on top of the baseline correctness. Need to somehow ensure
    the MSM result is correct? And even then, these optimnizations might not be enough to make this
    workload fast enough...let's start with correctness first though.
        Step 1: verify results from naive kernel and compare with barretenberg
        Step 2: check jacobian addition by 0, and P == Q checks
        Step 3: think about reducing pippenger to work on just two points
        Step 4: compare results

    The obvious problems is that [1] sum reduction kernel is inefficient because its performing a standard reduction.
    [2] the final accumulation is simply a double and add, which scales 273N. And on top of that, i'm not sure whether 
    the answer is correct. 

    6. ***Cannot just simply multiple a field element by a group element in order to calculate an exponentiation. The naive method would be a double and add formula, as I implemented. 

    7. Need to reconcile why a different value of C leads to different answers?
    Starting from the top, there are 5 kernels in the MSM calculation. The 'initialize_buckets_kernel'
    is trivial and will not be the problem. 'split_scalars_kernel' may be a problem, but I don't see any
    other way instead of using 64-bit values as barriers to split the scalars. The sorting algorithms 
    aren't the problem because it's the same code as used in Icicle. The 'accumulate_buckets_kernel'
    kernel seems to be correct since it's simply adding the value in the bucket, which will be a single value
    --- ie. the original point. The 'bucket_module_sum_reduction_lernel_0' kernel was checked using another
    kernel 'test_kernel' and the results match. The 'final_accumulation_kernel' performing the final
    double and add using "Horner's Rule" was checked against the exponentiation operation in barretenberg,
    and they yield the same results. 

    Therefore, I'm 1. not sure where the problem here lies, and 2. not sure why the value of 'c' is yielding
    different results. The only variable here is the split kernels method, but that was also directly
    taken from Ingonyama's Icicle library. Need to look deeper into what the problem here is...can't move
    on without solving this critical problem.

    I will check against the original Icicle library outputs and try to compare the logic, even though it's
    over a different elliptic curve (BLS-381). 

    Another option to experiemnt with using different point representations in the file, i.e. 1,2,1 instead?
    Update: looking at the original Icicle library, different choices of c result in a different answer, but 
    the overall MSM answer is correct. Additionally, the short_msm, large_msm, and reference_msm are all 
    yielding different answers, but the making conversions in rust to a final correct form. Need to investigate
    this. 

    Update: The issue was with the how the answer was being represented, i.e. montgomery form. Of course!

    8. Add notes on the different types of MSM baseline implementations.
    There is 1. Baseline MSM which performs a standard double and add, 2. Sum reduction technique,
    and 3. Bucket method. 

    9. At the moment, we have correctness errors for MSM with multiple points (ie. 2 points and 2 scalars for example)?
    Need to figure out why there's correctness issues. I'm also not getting the correct results trying to compare the
    naive double and add result to the pippenger result in barretenberg for some reason...Update: Seems like my naive double-and
    add and MSM implemnentation are yielding the same results for multiple points, and the result is correct when comparing against
    the naive double-and-add in the barretenberg repo. But, still remains the original conflict: comparing the naive double-and-add
    and MSM implementations in the barretneber codebase. Not sure what's causing that mismatch. Update: The reason was because we 
    were using pippenger_unsafe instead of pippenger, which may have triggered an exception for small problem size. 

    10. The performance is not good for the MSM kernel...Need to figure out what's bottlenecking the performance?
    I think it's because there's conditional branching due to the double function...look into it.

```MSM performance notes```
    Exploring performance bottlenecks: After setting up a simple bench, the bottleneck is not curve addition or the conditional doubling....a single for loop with 4 threads and 1 block can execute 2^15 additions in 4000 ms. I need to benchmark on A10 to figure out what's going on...Usage of too many registers might be the problem here. Additionally, I need to figure out why there are still correctness errors (ie. some tests pass and some fail on the same run)!    
    
    The issue is not with initialize buckets or split scalars kernels. Print statements add some time to the timings, but not much 
    in this case....accumulate buckets kernel is also not the problem since again, additions are fast. The bucket sum reduction kernel
    is slow for a couple reasons...1. it's a serial operation, 2. there are 2 additions per iteration, 3. the parallelism amount is low
    (launch parameters include 26 blocks and 4 threads ONLY). Need to look more into this kernel. We'll also remove the synchronization 
    primitive cudaDeviceSynchronize since kernel launches are asynchrous but execute serially in the same stream. CudaDeviceSynchroniza
    and swithching from unified memory to cudaMalloc didn't make any change really. I still haven't pinned point the main performance 
    bottleneck...which I suspect is the the number of registers not sure. Okay...now the conditional double adds 2x execution time in these
    kernels, but not in the baseline benches for some reason...need to reconcile that difference as well.  
    
    I'm curious if since the maximum registers per thread are the same, will the performance be similiar between A10 and P100
    if the bottleneck is the number of registers?

    Need to figure out the proper way to time as well. There's a huge dosparity between using chrono timer vs. Cuda events.

```Profiling discussion```
    For 2^15 constraints, profiling the kernel execution with "nsys profile --stats=true ./bin/arithmetic_cuda" and "sudo /usr/local/cuda/bin/ncu ./bin/arithmetic_cuda" highlights a low achieved occupancy on device. With regards to the execution time, bucket_running_sum_kernel accounts for 38%, final_accumulation_kernel for 31%, and accumulate_buckets_kernel for 28.1% of the runtime respectively. The radix sorting algorithm is negligible in comparison. Bumping up to 2^20 constraints, the accumulate_buckets_kernel call accounts for 91% of the runtime. It's obvious that as the constraint size increases, optimizing the bucket accumulation seems like a natural step. Both the achieved occupancy and SOL (compute %) are low, indicating the kernel launch parameters and actual kernel computational work aren't stressing the available device capabilities. The register pressure does not seems to be the cause.
